# The Gates of Morning/Book 1/Chapter 1
"The Gates of Morning"
Dick stood on a ledge of coral, his gaze fixed on the horizon. Behind him, the breakers of the outer sea crashed, spindrift scattering on the breeze; before him stretched an ocean calm as a lake, infinite, blue, and swept by fishing gulls—the lagoon of Karolin.
Clipped by its forty-mile ring of coral, this great pond was a sea unto itself, a tempestuous expanse in heavy winds, a lake of azure in lighter airs—and it was his, his domain, claimed only yesterday.
Along the shore, women, children, and youths of the tribe busied themselves in the blazing sun, fishing with nets, playing games, or tending the paraka patches. All were his people. His were the canoes drawn up on the sand, and his the empty houses where the war canoes had once rested on their rollers.
As his eyes shifted from the lagoon to the houses, his brow furrowed, and he turned his back to the lagoon, facing instead the breakers on the outer beach and the northern sea. Beyond the horizon, invisible, lay Palm Tree, an island as beautiful as a dream, yet swarming with devils.
Little Tari, son of Le Taioi the net maker, sat nearby on the coral, looking up at him. Tari knew little of life, but he understood that all the men of Karolin had been swept away by war, leaving the women, boys, and children like himself defenseless and without a leader.
Then, yesterday, from the northern sea in a strange boat, this new figure had come—sent by the gods, so the women said—to be their chief and ruler. The child knew nothing of gods, nor did he care. Alone now with this wonderful new person, and out of earshot of his mother, he asked directly, with the simplicity of childhood, "Taori, who are you?"
Could Dick have answered, would the child have understood the strange words of the story he might have told? "Tari, I come from people beyond the world you know. My name is Dick Lestrange, and when I was smaller than you, I was left alone with an old sailor man on that island you call Marua, fifty miles north. There we lived, and there I grew to be a boy. Kearney, the sailor, taught me to fish and spear, made me toys—little ships unlike the canoes of the islands. Then, one day, Katafa came, the girl blown away from here in a storm. She lived with us until Kearney died, and we were alone. She taught me her language, the language of Karolin. She named me Taori; we loved one another, and might have lived forever at Marua had not a great ship come, filled with bad men from the eastern islands of Melanesia. They cut the trees, killed the white men with them, burned the ship, and we escaped in our boat, steering for Karolin, led by the lagoon light in the sky."
But he could not tell Tari this, or at least not all of it. The name Dick had faded from his memory, along with the language of his childhood; Kearney, the sailor who had raised him, was all but forgotten, lost in the luminous haze of his past.
The past, for men long shipwrecked and alone, becomes blurred and fogged. For Dick, it began only with Katafa’s arrival on Marua. Beyond that, all was forgotten, consumed in the tropic light that bathed the island and the sea, the storms that swept the coconut groves, the mists of the rainy seasons. Kearney would have been forgotten but for the little ships he had made for the boy—who was now a man.
Dick looked down at the questioning child. "I am Taori, Tari tatu, why do you ask?"
"I do not know," said the child. "I ask as I breathe, but no big folk—madyana—will ever answer the questions of Tari. Ai, the fish!" His facile mind had already dropped the subject, distracted by the cries of children hauling in a net. He rose and trotted away.
Dick turned his gaze again to the north. The child’s question had stirred his mind, and he saw again the schooner burned by Melanesian hands, Katafa and himself escaping in the old dinghy Kearney had taught him to handle as a boy. He saw their landing on this beach yesterday, the women and children swarming round him, hailing him as the man sent by the gods to lead them.
As he gazed north, the memory of the men they had escaped stained the beauty of sea and sky. There was no immediate fear of those men; they had no canoes, but they would build them. Surely they would build canoes and see the mirror blaze of Karolin’s lagoon in the distance, just as he had. They would come. It might be a long time yet, but they would come.
Dick was almost a block, a kanaka, a savage, yet the white man was there too. He could think forward, think round a subject, and imagine. That was why he had sent a canoe that morning to fetch Aioma, Palia, and Tafata, three old men, too old for war but expert canoe-builders. That was why, gazing at the tribe in full congregation, his eyes had brightened at the sight of nearly a hundred youths ripening to war age.
Under all, lighting and animating his mind, raising his daring to eagle heights, lay his passion for Katafa, his other self, more dear to him than life, threatened—ever so vaguely, yet still threatened.
War canoes! Did he intend to fight invaders in the lagoon or as they drew toward shore? Or did he vaguely plan to attack first, destroying the danger at its source? Who knows?
A hand fell on his shoulder, and turning, he faced Katafa. A lock of her dark hair escaped the thread of elastic vine that bound it, blowing back like an eagle’s feather in the breeze. Her luminous, dark eyes, instead of meeting his, were fixed on the northern sea line.
At intervals, in certain weather, Palm Tree became visible from Karolin through the mirage. Last evening they had seen it, and now it was beginning to reappear—a mysterious stain low in the southern sky, a dull spot in the sea dazzle, deepening by degrees until, as if sketched by an unseen painter, the island took shape, beautiful as a dream, diaphanous yet vivid.
With her hand on his shoulder, they stood without speaking, their untutored minds fixed on the place they had escaped, now rising strangely beyond the far sea line as if to gaze at them.
They saw again the horde of savages on the beach, monstrous as figures in a nightmare. They felt the wind that filled the sail as the dinghy raced for safety, and they heard again the yells of the Melanesians, mad with stolen rum, burning the schooner they had brought. Before them lay the scene of the tragedy, a lovely picture that showed nothing of the demons still inhabiting it.
As Dick gazed on this loveliness, which was yet a threat and a warning, his nostrils expanded, and his eyes darkened with hate. They had threatened him—nothing—but they had threatened Katafa, and they still threatened her.
Some day they would come. The vision of Palm Tree seemed to echo what instinct told him. They would build canoes and see the lagoon’s mirror-light in the sky, and they would come. They had no women, those men, and here were women. Instinct half whispered that just as he had been drawn to Katafa, so would these men be drawn to the women of Karolin. They would scan the horizon for some island whose tribe might be raided, and seeing the lagoon light, they would come.
Ah, if he had known, danger lay not only to the north but wherever greed, desire, or hatred roamed on that azure sea—not only among savages but the wolves of civilization.
To Dick, there was no world beyond the water that ringed the two islands; no Europe, no America, no history but the short life he had lived with Katafa. Yet even in that life, he had learned to dread men and seen the foundation of all history—man’s instinct for war, rapine, and destruction.
Then the vision of Palm Tree began to fade, vanishing suddenly like a blown-out light. Turning from the sea to the lagoon, Katafa pointed across the water to a canoe approaching from the southern beach.
It was the canoe Dick had sent for the canoe builders. Leaving the coral, they descended to the white sand of the inner beach to meet it.
