# The Gates of Morning/Book 1/Chapter 3
The primitive canoe of the Pacific is a dugout—the trunk of a tree, shaped into a narrow, unstable boat, saved from capsizing only by the outrigger attached to its port side.
This ingenious outrigger, a long, flat piece of wood, fixed to the central bridge, is a compromise with the sea, allowing the canoe to brave the waves on one condition: it must respect the sea's power. Without the outrigger, no canoe would dare venture into the open waters, and the islands would remain isolated, war would be impossible, and the exchange of ideas between island and continent would cease.
Somewhere in the past, a visionary stood, the father of this daring invention, unaware of the consequences of his creation.
As Dick steered the canoe towards the northern beach, he spotted Katafa waiting for him, her wind-blown girdle of dracæna leaves, her hand shading her eyes from the sun. She stood, just as Le Moan stood on the southern beach, watching the canoe that carried the first man who had ever caught her attention.
Some children played near Katafa, and a fishing canoe was setting out nearby, but Dick's eyes were fixed only on Katafa.
"Katafa," Aioma said, crouched by the outrigger pole. "It's her, for sure, and they said she was dead, and her ghost had returned, bringing you with her, Taori, but the dead don't return. Katafa, she was the girl under Taminan's taboo, the girl no man or woman could touch, and then one day, she went fishing beyond the reef, and a storm took her, and she was drowned, so they said."
"She wasn't drowned," he replied. "The wind blew her to Marua, where I was, with another whose face I've almost forgotten, Kearney, who made canoes, but not like these. Then one day, he went into the trees and didn't return. The god Nan came to the island, and after him, the men of Karolin, who fought until all were killed. Then came the bad men, who would have killed us, but we left Marua in the night... Look, there's the canoe we came in." He pointed to the dinghy hauled up on the shore.
"O he! Taori!" Katafa's voice called out from the shore, glad, sweet, and clear as a bell, yet far-carrying as a gull's cry.
As Dick sprang out onto the sand, he seized her in his arms; it seemed to them that they had been weeks apart, not just hours.
In the old days, even before he was born, his mother Emmeline had never been at ease when separated from his father, even by the breadth of the lagoon. The demon that hinted at mischance seemed always at her ear.
Dick seemed to have inherited, with his power of love for Katafa, a dread of mischance for the beloved.
He embraced her, heedless of onlookers, though the only eyes that saw were the children's and Aioma's, who had eyes for nothing but the dinghy.
As soon as his foot touched the sand, the canoe-builder made for it, running like a boy, clapping his hand on the gunnel, and then running it over the planking.
The boats of the Spanish ship of long ago had been clinker-built and destroyed in the fight, but he had seen bits of them washed ashore on the southern beach. The dinghy was carvel-built and entire, a perfect specimen of eastern boat-building, over which the canoe designer brooded, forgetful of Dick and Katafa, the beach he stood on, and the sun that lit it.
The idea of a boat built from planking and not hollowed out of a tree trunk had been presented to him by the charred and shattered fragments of the Spanish boats, but how to get planking and how to bend it to the form he desired was beyond his imagination and means. He saw vaguely that these boats of the papalagi were constructed somewhat like a man, with a backbone and ribs, and a covering for the ribs. He saw that by this means, enough beam could be obtained to enable the builder to dispense with the outrigger—but then, speed, where was there a sign of speed in this squat and ugly thing?
In the early ages of the world, which Aioma still dwelled, ugliness had only two expressions: the lines that indicated want of speed and the lines that indicated want of strength.
Dick, though brown as the canoe-builder and almost indistinguishable from a true islander, was perhaps a million years younger than Aioma, just as the dinghy was a million years younger than the fishing canoe that had just brought him across the lagoon. In Dick, Aioma saw the lines that indicated speed and strength, nothing more—he was blind to the nobility of type expressed by that daring face, to the far-sightedness of the eyes, and the breadth of the brow; in the dinghy, Aioma saw want of speed—he was blind to the nobility of type that made this bud the sister of a battleship, made it a vertebrate as against the dugout, which has neither keel nor ribs.
Then Aioma, standing in the sun, a plain canoe-builder and workman in the sight of God and a critic as every true workman is, began to deride the dinghy, at first with chuckles deep down in his throat, then with a sound like the clacking of a hen, then with laughter long and loud and words of derision.
"Which end is which of this pig fish?" Aioma inquired of heaven and Dick, "and he who made her, how many more did he make like her?"
Dick, who had always connected the dinghy with Kearney, and who had a sort of faith that Kearney had made her, just as he had made the little model ships, winced at the laughter of the old man. Perhaps it was the white man in him revolting against the derision of a savage over the works of the white man. However that may be, he turned and ran up the beach to the house of Uta Matu, which he and Katafa had made their own. There, in the shadow, on a hastily constructed shelf stood the little model ships he had so carefully salvaged from Palm Tree: the frigate, the schooner, the full-rigged ship, and the whale man, the last thread connecting him with civilization; toys of the long ago, but no longer toys—fetishes from a world whose very language he had lost, a world of sun and tall trees where, like a ghost in the sun's dazzle, moved a memory that was once a man—Kearney.
He took the schooner from its rest and, coming out with it, ran to a great pool in the coral, calling Aioma to come and see what he who made the dinghy had also made.
The pool, thirty feet long by twenty broad, was ruffled by the breeze from the sea, clear as crystal, coral-floored, and a trapped school of tiny fish no larger than needles passed like a silver cloud here and there. Dick, on his knees, launched the schooner, and Aioma, standing bent with a hand on each knee, watched her as she floated on an even keel. Then, on the merry west wind, with helm properly set and main boom guyed out, she went sailing down the pool to the east, where Katafa had run to receive her.
Aioma watched, then Dick, running to the other end, showed him how she could sail almost against the wind. Dick knew every stick and string of her, how to hoist and lower main and fore, and how to set the head sails—and had you placed him on a real schooner, he could have worked her from his knowledge of the model. Aioma watched, vastly intrigued; then, taking a hand, he got on his knees, and the great sun saw the builders of the future fleet of Karolin playing like children, while the little schooner on its imitation sea sailed from port to port, bowing to the ripples of the pool as the lost Raratonga, of which it was the model, had bowed to the swell of the great Pacific.
