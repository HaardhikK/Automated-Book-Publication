    "# The Gates of Morning/Book 1/Chapter 1\n\"The Gates of Morning\"\nDick stood on a ledge of coral, his gaze cast to the horizon. Behind him, the breakers of the outer sea crashed and spindrift scattered on the breeze; before him stretched an ocean calm as a lake, infinite, blue, and flown about by the fishing gulls—the lagoon of Karolin.\nClipped by its forty-mile ring of coral, this great pond was a sea in itself, a sea of storm in heavy winds, a lake of azure in light airs—and it was his, his domain, which he had claimed only yesterday.\nWomen, children, youths, all the tribe, busied along the shore in the blazing sun, fishing with nets, playing their games, or working on the paraka patches. All were his people. His were the canoes drawn up on the sand, and his the empty houses where the war canoes had once rested on their rollers.\nThen, as he cast his eyes from the lagoon to the houses, his brow contracted, and, turning his back to the lagoon, he stood facing the breakers on the outer beach and the northern sea. Away there, beyond the sea line, invisible, lay Palm Tree, an island beautiful as a dream, yet swarming with devils.\nLittle Tari, the son of Le Taioi the net maker, sat on the coral close by, looked up at him. Tari knew little of life, but he knew that all the men of Karolin, swept away by war, had left the women and the boys and the children like himself defenseless and without a man or leader.\nThen, yesterday, from the northern sea in a strange boat, and with Katafa, the girl who had been blown to sea years ago when out fishing, this strange new figure had come, sent by the gods, so the women said, to be their chief and ruler.\nThe child knew nothing of whom the gods might be, nor did he care, alone now with this wonderful new person, and out of earshot of his mother, he put the question direct with all the simplicity of childhood.\n\"Taori,\" said little Tari, \"who are you?\" (é kamina tai)\nCould Dick have answered, would the child have understood the strange words of the strange story Dick might have told him? \"Tari, I come of people beyond the world you know. My name is Dick Lestrange, and when I was smaller than you, Tari, I was left alone with an old sailor man on that island you call Marua (Palm Tree), which lies beyond sight fifty miles to the north. There we lived, and there I grew to be a boy, and Kearney, that was his name, taught me to fish and spear fish, and he made for me things to play with, little ships unlike the canoes of the islands. And then, Tari, one day long ago, came Katafa, the girl who was blown away from here in a storm. She lived with us till Kearney died, and then we two were alone. She taught me her language, which is the language of Karolin. She named me Taori; we loved one another, and might have lived forever at Marua had not a great ship come there filled with bad men, men from the eastern islands of Melanesia. They came to cut the trees. Then they rose and killed the white men with them and burned the ship, and in our boat, we escaped from them, taking with us everything we loved, even the little ships, and steering for Karolin, we came, led by the lagoon light in the sky.\"\nBut he could not tell Tari this, or at least all of it, for the very name of Dick had passed from his memory, that and the language he had spoken as a child; Kearney, the sailor who had brought him up, was all but forgotten, all but lost sight of in the luminous haze that was his past.\nThe past, for men long shipwrecked and alone, becomes blurred and fogged, for Dick, it began only with the coming of Katafa to Marua, behind and beyond that all was forgotten as though consumed in the great blaze of tropic light that bathed the island and the sea, the storms that swept the coconut groves, the mists of the rainy seasons. Kearney would have been quite forgotten but for the little ships he had made as playthings for the boy—who was now a man.\nHe looked down at the questioning child. \"I am Taori, Tari tatu, why do you ask?\"\n\"I do not know,\" said the child. \"I ask as I breathe, but no big folk—madyana—will ever answer the questions of Tari— Ai, the fish!\" His facile mind had already dropped the subject, attracted by the cries of some children, hauling in a net, and he rose and trotted away.\nDick turned his gaze again to the north. The question of the child had stirred his mind, and he saw again the schooner that had put in to Palm Tree only to be burned by the Melanesian hands, he saw again Katafa and himself as they made their escape in the old dinghy that Kearney had taught him to handle as a boy. He saw their landing on this beach, yesterday, and the women and children swarming round him, he the man whom they considered sent by the gods to be their chief and leader.\nThen as he gazed towards the north, the memory of the men from whom he had escaped with the girl stained the beauty of sea and sky.\nThere was no immediate fear of the men who had taken possession of Palm Tree; the men of Palm Tree had no canoes, but they would build canoes—surely they would build canoes, and as surely they would see the far mirror blaze of Karolin lagoon in the distance, just as he had seen it, and they would come. It might be a very long time yet, but they would come.\nDick was an almost block, a kanaka, a savage, and yet the white man was there. He could think forward, he could think round a subject, and he could imagine.\nThat was why he had sent a canoe that morning across to the southern beach to fetch Aioma, Palia, and Tafata, three old men, too old for war, but expert canoe-builders, that was why when gazing at the tribe in full congregation, his eyes had brightened to the fact that nearly a hundred of the youths were ripening to war age, but under all, lighting and animating his mind, raising daring to eagle heights, lay his passion for Katafa, his other self, more dear to him than self, threatened, ever so vaguely, yet still threatened.\nWar canoes! Did he intend fighting any invaders in the lagoon or as they drew towards shore, or did he vaguely intend to be the attacker, destroying the danger at its source before it could develop? Who knows?\nA hand fell upon his shoulder, and turning, he found himself face to face with Katafa, a lock of her dark hair escaped from the thread of elastic vine that bound it, blew right back on the breeze like an eagle's feather, and her eyes, luminous and dark, instead of meeting his, were fixed towards the point where he had been gazing—the due-north sea line.\nAt big intervals and in certain conditions of weather, Palm Tree, though far behind the sea line, became visible from Karolin through mirage. Last evening they had seen it, and now again it was beginning to live, to bloom, to come to life, a mysterious stain low down in the southern sky, a dull spot in the sea dazzle, that deepened by degrees and hardened till as if sketched in by some unseen painter, the island showed beautiful as a dream, diaphanous, yet vivid.\nWith her hand upon his shoulder, they stood without speaking, their minds untutored, knowing nothing of mirage, their eyes fixed on the place from which they had escaped and which was rising now so strangely beyond the far sea line as if to gaze at them.\nThey saw again the horde of savages on the beach, figures monstrous as the forms in a nightmare, they felt again the wind that filled the sail as the dinghy raced for safety and the open sea, and again they heard the yells of the Melanesians mad with rum stolen from the schooner they had brought in, and which they had burnt. And there, there before them lay the scene of the Tragedy, that lovely picture which showed nothing of the demons that still inhabited it.\nThen as Dick gazed on this loveliness, which was yet a threat and a warning, his nostrils expanded, and his eyes grew dark with hate. They had threatened him—that was nothing, they had threatened Katafa, that was everything—and they still threatened her.\nSome day they would come. The vision of Palm Tree seemed to repeat what instinct told him. They would build canoes and seeing the lagoon mirror-light in the sky, they would come. They had no women, those men, and here were women, and instinct half whispered to him that just as he had been drawn to Katafa, so would these men be drawn to the women of Karolin. They would scan the horizon in search of some island whose tribe might be raided of its women, and seeing the lagoon light, they would come.\nAh, if he had known, danger lay not only to the north but wherever greed or desire or hatred might roam on that azure sea, not only amongst savages, but the wolves of civilization.\nTo Dick, there was no world beyond the world of water that ringed the two islands; no Europe, no America, no history but the history of his short life as the life of Katafa, and yet even in that life, short as it was, he had learned to dread men, and he had envisaged the foundation of all history—man's instinct for war, rapine, and destruction.\nThen gradually the vision of Palm Tree began to fade and pass, suddenly it vanished like a light blown out, and as they turned from the sea to the lagoon, Katafa pointed across the lagoon water to a canoe approaching from the southern beach.\nIt was the canoe Dick had sent for the canoe builders, and, leaving the coral, they came down to the white sand of the inner beach to meet it.",
    "# The Gates of Morning/Book 1/Chapter 1\n\"The Gates of Morning\"\nDick stood on a ledge of coral, his gaze cast to the horizon. Behind him, the breakers of the outer sea crashed and spindrift scattered on the breeze; before him stretched an ocean calm as a lake, infinite, blue, and flown about by the fishing gulls—the lagoon of Karolin.\nClipped by its forty-mile ring of coral, this great pond was a sea in itself, a sea of storm in heavy winds, a lake of azure in light airs—and it was his, his domain, which he had claimed only yesterday.\nWomen, children, youths, all the tribe, busied along the shore in the blazing sun, fishing with nets, playing their games, or working on the paraka patches.

    "# The Gates of Morning/Book 1/Chapter 1\n\"The Gates of Morning\"\nDick stood on a ledge of coral, his gaze fixed on the horizon. Behind him, the breakers of the outer sea crashed, spindrift scattering on the breeze; before him stretched an ocean calm as a lake, infinite, blue, and swept by fishing gulls—the lagoon of Karolin.\nClipped by its forty-mile ring of coral, this great pond was a sea unto itself, a tempestuous expanse in heavy winds, a lake of azure in lighter airs—and it was his, his domain, claimed only yesterday.\nAlong the shore, women, children, and youths of the tribe busied themselves in the blazing sun, fishing with nets, playing games, or tending the paraka patches. All were his people. His were the canoes drawn up on the sand, and his the empty houses where the war canoes had once rested on their rollers.\nAs his eyes shifted from the lagoon to the houses, his brow furrowed, and he turned his back to the lagoon, facing instead the breakers on the outer beach and the northern sea. Beyond the horizon, invisible, lay Palm Tree, an island as beautiful as a dream, yet swarming with devils.\nLittle Tari, son of Le Taioi the net maker, sat nearby on the coral, looking up at him. Tari knew little of life, but he understood that all the men of Karolin had been swept away by war, leaving the women, boys, and children like himself defenseless and without a leader.\nThen, yesterday, from the northern sea in a strange boat, this new figure had come—sent by the gods, so the women said—to be their chief and ruler. The child knew nothing of gods, nor did he care. Alone now with this wonderful new person, and out of earshot of his mother, he asked directly, with the simplicity of childhood, \"Taori, who are you?\"\nCould Dick have answered, would the child have understood the strange words of the story he might have told? \"Tari, I come from people beyond the world you know. My name is Dick Lestrange, and when I was smaller than you, I was left alone with an old sailor man on that island you call Marua, fifty miles north. There we lived, and there I grew to be a boy. Kearney, the sailor, taught me to fish and spear, made me toys—little ships unlike the canoes of the islands. Then, one day, Katafa came, the girl blown away from here in a storm. She lived with us until Kearney died, and we were alone. She taught me her language, the language of Karolin.

The name Dick had faded from his memory, along with the language of his childhood; Kearney, the sailor who had raised him, was all but forgotten, lost in the luminous haze of his past.\nThe past, for men long shipwrecked and alone, becomes blurred and fogged. For Dick, it began only with Katafa’s arrival on Marua. Beyond that, all was forgotten, consumed in the tropic light that bathed the island and the sea, the storms that swept the coconut groves, the mists of the rainy seasons. Kearney would have been forgotten but for the little ships he had made for the boy—who was now a man.\nDick looked down at the questioning child. \"I am Taori, Tari tatu, why do you ask?\"\n\"I do not know,\" said the child. \"I ask as I breathe, but no big folk—madyana—will ever answer the questions of Tari. Ai, the fish!\" His facile mind had already dropped the subject, distracted by the cries of children hauling in a net. He rose and trotted away.\nDick turned his gaze again to the north. The child’s question had stirred his mind, and he saw again the schooner burned by Melanesian hands, Katafa and himself escaping in the old dinghy Kearney had taught him to handle as a boy. He saw their landing on this beach yesterday, the women and children swarming round him, hailing him as the man sent by the gods to lead them.\nAs he gazed north, the memory of the men they had escaped stained the beauty of sea and sky. There was no immediate fear of those men; they had no canoes, but they would build them. Surely they would build canoes and see the mirror blaze of Karolin’s lagoon in the distance, just as he had. They would come. It might be a long time yet, but they would come.\nDick was almost a block, a kanaka, a savage, yet the white man was there too. He could think forward, think round a subject, and imagine. That was why he had sent a canoe that morning to fetch Aioma, Palia, and Tafata, three old men, too old for war but expert canoe-builders. That was why, gazing at the tribe in full congregation, his eyes had brightened at the sight of nearly a hundred youths ripening to war age.\nUnder all, lighting and animating his mind, raising his daring to eagle heights, lay his passion for Katafa, his other self, more dear to him than life, threatened—ever so vaguely, yet still threatened.\nWar canoes! Did he intend to fight invaders in the lagoon or as they drew toward shore? Or did he vaguely plan to attack first, destroying the danger at its source? Who knows?\nA hand fell on his shoulder, and turning, he faced Katafa. A lock of her dark hair escaped the thread of elastic vine that bound it, blowing back like an eagle’s feather in the breeze. Her luminous, dark eyes, instead of meeting his, were fixed on the northern sea line.\nAt intervals, in certain weather, Palm Tree became visible from Karolin through the mirage. Last evening they had seen it, and now it was beginning to reappear—a mysterious stain low in the southern sky, a dull spot in the sea dazzle, deepening by degrees until, as if sketched by an unseen painter, the island took shape, beautiful as a dream, diaphanous yet vivid.\nWith her hand on his shoulder, they stood without speaking, their untutored minds fixed on the place they had escaped, now rising strangely beyond the far sea line as if to gaze at them.\nThey saw again the horde of savages on the beach, monstrous as figures in a nightmare. They felt the wind that filled the sail as the dinghy raced for safety, and they heard again the yells of the Melanesians, mad with stolen rum, burning the schooner they had brought. Before them lay the scene of the tragedy, a lovely picture that showed nothing of the demons still inhabiting it.\nAs Dick gazed on this loveliness, which was yet a threat and a warning, his nostrils expanded, and his eyes darkened with hate. They had threatened him—nothing—but they had threatened Katafa, and they still threatened her.\nSome day they would come. The vision of Palm Tree seemed to echo what instinct told him.

Yet even in that life, he had learned to dread men and seen the foundation of all history—man’s instinct for war, rapine, and destruction.\nThen the vision of Palm Tree began to fade, vanishing suddenly like a blown-out light. Turning from the sea to the lagoon, Katafa pointed across the water to a canoe approaching from the southern beach.\nIt was the canoe Dick had sent for the canoe builders. Leaving the coral, they descended to the white sand of the inner beach to meet it.",
    "# The Gates of Morning/Book 1/Chapter 2\nTHE REVOLT OF THE OLD MEN\nTwo women expertly beached the canoe, its outrigger tilting precariously. As Dick approached, his hand instinctively grasped the mast stays attached to the outrigger gratings. He turned to the women, who stood paddles in hand, their eyes darting between him and Katafa.\n\"And the builders?\" Dick's gaze probed, \"where are they?\"\nThe shorter woman clicked her tongue and turned away, gazing out at the lagoon. The taller one met Dick's gaze squarely.\n\"They will not come,\" she stated, her voice firm. \"They say Uta Matu was their only king, and now he's dead. They claim they're too old, 'A mataya ayana'—too feeble for fishing, even in calm waters.\"\nThe shorter woman choked back a laugh, then turned to Dick, her eyes sparkling with amusement.\n\"They won't come, all else is just talk.\"\nShe was right. The express order to cross over had been disobeyed; the old men refused to acknowledge the new chief. The subject was already being whispered about by the villagers gathering around the canoe. Meanwhile, Dick stood with his eyes fixed on the sennit binding of the outrigger pole, as if studying it intensely.\nThe blaze of anger in his eyes had passed; anger had given way to calculation. This was no ordinary matter. Dick may not have known the words \"revolt\" or \"authority,\" but he could think quite well without them. The only men capable of directing the building of the big war canoes were refusing to work, and from the tone and looks of the women, Dick saw clearly that if something wasn't done to bring the canoe-builders to heel, his power to make the natives do things would be lost.\nDick never wasted much time in thought. He turned from the canoe, sprinted up to the house where the little ships were carefully stored, and raced back with a fish spear.\nThen, calling to the women, he helped run the canoe out, sprang on board, and helped raise the mat sail to the wind blowing in from the break.\n\"I will soon return,\" he cried out to Katafa, his voice carried across the sparkling water on a slant of the wind. The women crouched down to ballast the canoe, and with the steering paddle in hand, Dick steered.\nThe canoe that had brought Katafa drifting to Palm Tree years ago had been the first South Sea island craft Dick had seen. The fascination of it had remained with him. This canoe was bigger, broader of beam, and the long skate-shaped piece of wood that formed the outrigger was connected to it not by outrigger poles but by a bridge.\nAs Dick steered, he took in every little detail: the rattans of the grating, the way the mast stays were fixed to the grating, and how the mast itself was stepped; the outrigger and the curve of its ends; the mat sail and the way it was fastened to the yard.\nThough he had never steered a canoe before, the sea-craft inborn in him carried him through. The women crouching and watching and noting every detail saw nothing indicative of indecision.\nNow, there are two ways in which one may upset a canoe of this sort by bad handling: one is to let the outrigger leave the water and tilt too high in the air, the other is to let the outrigger dip too deep in the water.\nDick seemed to know, and as they crossed the big lift of sea coming in with the flood from the break, he avoided both dangers with ease.\nThe beach where the remnants of the southern tribe lived was exactly opposite to the beach of the northern tribe, and as both beaches were close to the break in the reef, the distance from one to the other was little over a mile. As they drew close, Dick could see more distinctly the few remaining huts under the shelter of a grove of Jack-fruit trees; beyond the Jack-fruit stood pandanus palms bending lagoonward, and three tall coconut palms sharp against the white up-flaring horizon.\nAs the canoe beached, Dick saw the rebels. They were seated on the sand close to the most easterly of the huts, seated in the shadow of the Jack-fruit leaves; three old men seated, two with their knees up and one tailor-fashion, whilst close to them by the edge of a little pool lay a girl.\nAs Dick drew near, followed by the taller of the boat women, the girl, who had been gazing into the waters of the pool, looked up, and saw him.\nShe was Le Moan, granddaughter of Le Juan, the witch woman of Karolin now dead and gone to meet judgment for the destruction she had caused. Le Moan was only fourteen. She had heard of the coming of the new ruler to Karolin and of his bringing with him Katafa, the girl long thought to be dead. She had heard the order given to her grandfather Aioma that morning to come at once to the northern beach as the new chief required canoes to be built, and she had heard the old man's refusal. Le Moan had wondered what this new chief might be like. The monstrous great figure of Uta Matu, last king of Karolin, had come up in memory at the word \"chief,\" and now, as the canoe was hauled up and the women cried out \"He comes,\" she saw Dick.\nDick with the sun on his face and on his red-gold hair, Dick naked and honey-colored, lithe as a panther and straight as a stabbing spear. Dick with his eyes fixed on the three old men of Karolin who had turned their heads to gaze on him.\nLe Moan drew in her breath, then she seemed to cease breathing as the vision approached, passed her without a word, and stood facing Aioma, the eldest and the greatest of the canoe-builders.\nLe Moan was only fourteen, yet she was tall, almost as tall as Katafa, she was not a true Polynesian; though her mother had been a native of Karolin, her father, a sailor from a Spanish ship destroyed years ago by Uta Matu, had given the girl European characteristics so strong that she stood apart from the other islanders as a pine might stand amongst palm trees.\nShe was beautiful, with a dark beauty just beginning to unfold from the bud, and she was strange as the sea depths themselves. Sometimes seated alone beneath the towering Jack-fruits, her head would poise as though she were listening, as though some voice were calling through the sound of the surf on the reef, some voice whose words she could not quite catch; and sometimes she would sit above the reef pools gazing deep down into the water, the crystal water where coralline growths bloomed and fish swam, but where she seemed to see more things than fish.\nThe sharp mixture of two utterly alien races sometimes produces strange results—it was almost at times as if Le Moan were confused by voices or visions from lands of ancestry worlds apart.\nShe would go with Aioma fishing, and with her on board, Aioma never dreaded losing sight of land, for Le Moan was a pathfinder.\nBlindfold her on the coral, and she would yet find her way on foot; take her beyond the sea-line, and she would return like a homing pigeon. Like the pigeon, she had the compass in her brain.\nThis was the only gift she had received from her mother, La Jennabon, who had received it from seafaring ancestors of the remote past.\nCrouching by the well, she saw now Dick standing before Aioma, and she heard his voice.\n\"You are Aioma?\" said Dick, who had singled the chief of the three out by instinct.\nThe three old men rose to their feet. The sight of the newcomer helped, but it was the singling out of Aioma with such success by one who had never seen him that produced the effect. Surely here was a chief.\n\"I am Aioma,\" replied the other. \"What want you with me?\"\n\"That which the woman had already told you,\" replied Dick, who hated waste of words or repeating himself.\n\"They told me of the new chief who had come to the northern beach—e uma kaio tau, and of how he had ordered canoes to be built,\" said Aioma, \"and I said, 'I am too old, and Uta is dead, and I know no chief but Uta; also in the last war on that Island in the north all the men of Karolin fell and they have never returned, they nor their canoes.' So what is the use of building more canoes when there are no men to fill them?\"\n\"The men are growing,\" said Dick.\n\"Ay, they are growing,\" grumbled Aioma, \"but it will be many moons before they are ready to take the paddle and the spear—and even so, where is the enemy? The sea is clear.\"\n\"Aioma,\" said Dick, \"I have come from there,\" pointing to the north; \"the sea is not clear.\"\n\"You have come from Marua (Palm Tree)?\"\n\"I have come from Marua, where one day Katafa came, drifted from here in her canoe; there we lived till a little while ago when men landed, killing and breaking and burning—burning even the big canoe they had come in. Then Katafa and I set sail for Karolin, for Karolin called me to rule her people.\"\n\"And the men who landed to kill and burn?\" asked Aioma.\n\"They are still on Marua; they have no canoes but they will build them, and surely they will come.\"\nNeither of Aioma's companions said a word, while Aioma stood looking at the ground as if consulting it, then his eyes rose to Dick's face. Age and war had made Aioma wise, he knew men and he knew Truth when he saw her.\n\"I will do your bidding, Taori,\" said he quite simply, then he turned to the others, spoke some words to them, giving directions what to do till his return, and led the way to the canoe.\nLe Moan, still crouching by the well, said nothing. Her eyes were fixed on Dick, this creature so new, so different from any one she had ever seen. Perhaps the race spirit was telling her that here was a being of her father's race miraculously come to Karolin, perhaps she was held simply by the grace and youth of the newcomer—who knows?\nDick, as he turned, noticed her fully for the first time, and as their eyes met, he paused, held by her gaze and the strangeness of her appearance, so different from that of the other natives. For a moment his mind seemed trapped, then as his eyes fell, he passed on and taking the steering paddle, pushed off, the wind from the reef-break filling the sail of the canoe.\nLe Moan, rising and shading her eyes, stood watching as the sail grew less across the sparkling water, watching as the canoe rose and fell on the swell setting in from the break, watching as it reached the far white line of the northern beach where Katafa was waiting for the return of her lover.\nAs the canoe drew near, Katafa's voice hailed them from the shore, glad, sweet, clear as a bell, yet far-carrying as the voice of a gull.\n\"O he! Taori!\" It was Katafa's voice, glad, sweet, clear as a bell, yet far-carrying as the voice of a gull.\nAs Dick sprang out on the sands, he seized her in his arms; parted only a few hours, it seemed to them that they had been weeks apart.\nIn the old days, even before he was born, his mother Emmeline had never been at ease when separated from his father even by the breadth of the lagoon, the demon that hints of mischance seemed always at her ear.\nDick seemed to have inherited with his power of love for Katafa, something of the dread of mischance for the beloved.\nHe embraced her, heedless of onlookers, though the only eyes to see were the eyes of the children and of Aioma, who had eyes for nothing but the dinghy.\nAs soon as his foot touched sand, the canoe-builder made for it, running like a boy, clapped his hand on the gunnel, and then ran it over the planking.\nThe boats of the Spanish ship of long ago had been clinker-built and had been destroyed in the fight, but he had seen bits of them washed ashore on the southern beach.

    "# The Gates of Morning/Book 1/Chapter 2\nTHE REVOLT OF THE OLD MEN\nTwo women expertly beached the canoe, its outrigger tilting precariously. As Dick approached, his hand instinctively grasped the mast stays attached to the outrigger gratings. He turned to the women, who stood paddles in hand, their eyes darting between him and Katafa.\n\"And the builders?\" Dick's gaze probed. \"Where are they?\"\nThe shorter woman clicked her tongue in disgust and turned away, gazing out at the lagoon. The taller one met Dick's gaze squarely.\n\"They will not come,\" she stated, her voice firm. \"They say Uta Matu was their only king, and now he's dead. They claim they're too old, 'A mataya ayana'—too feeble for fishing, even in calm waters.\"\nThe shorter woman choked back a laugh, then turned to Dick, her eyes sparkling with amusement.\n\"They won't come,\" she said. \"All else is just talk.\"\nShe was right. The express order to cross over had been disobeyed; the old men refused to acknowledge the new chief. The subject was already being whispered about by the villagers gathering around the canoe. Meanwhile, Dick stood with his eyes fixed on the sennit binding of the outrigger pole, as if studying it intensely.\nThe blaze of anger in his eyes had passed; anger had given way to calculation. This was no ordinary matter. Dick may not have known the words \"revolt\" or \"authority,\" but he could think quite well without them. The only men capable of directing the building of the big war canoes were refusing to work, and from the tone and looks of the women, Dick saw clearly that if something wasn't done to bring the canoe-builders to heel, his power to make the natives do things would be lost.\nDick never wasted much time in thought. He turned from the canoe, sprinted up to the house where the little ships were carefully stored, and raced back with a fish spear. Then, calling to the women, he helped run the canoe out, sprang on board, and helped raise the mat sail to the wind blowing in from the break.\n\"I will soon return,\" he cried out to Katafa, his voice carried across the sparkling water on a slant of the wind. The women crouched down to ballast the canoe, and with the steering paddle in hand, Dick steered.\nThe canoe that had brought Katafa drifting to Palm Tree years ago had been the first South Sea island craft Dick had seen. The fascination of it had remained with him. This canoe was bigger, broader of beam, and the long skate-shaped piece of wood that formed the outrigger was connected to it not by outrigger poles but by a bridge.\nAs Dick steered, he took in every little detail: the rattans of the grating, the way the mast stays were fixed to the grating, and how the mast itself was stepped; the outrigger and the curve of its ends; the mat sail and the way it was fastened to the yard.\nThough he had never steered a canoe before, the sea-craft inborn in him carried him through. The women crouching and watching and noting every detail saw nothing indicative of indecision.\nNow, there are two ways in which one may upset a canoe of this sort by bad handling: one is to let the outrigger leave the water and tilt too high in the air, the other is to let the outrigger dip too deep in the water. Dick seemed to know, and as they crossed the big lift of sea coming in with the flood from the break, he avoided both dangers with ease.\nThe beach where the remnants of the southern tribe lived was exactly opposite to the beach of the northern tribe, and as both beaches were close to the break in the reef, the distance from one to the other was little over a mile. As they drew close, Dick could see more distinctly the few remaining huts under the shelter of a grove of jack-fruit trees; beyond the jack-fruit stood pandanus palms bending lagoonward, and three tall coconut palms sharp against the white up-flaring horizon.\nAs the canoe beached, Dick saw the rebels. They were seated on the sand close to the most easterly of the huts, seated in the shadow of the jack-fruit leaves; three old men seated, two with their knees up and one tailor-fashion, whilst close to them by the edge of a little pool lay a girl.\nAs Dick drew near, followed by the taller of the boat women, the girl, who had been gazing into the waters of the pool, looked up, and saw him.\nShe was Le Moan, granddaughter of Le Juan, the witch woman of Karolin now dead and gone to meet judgment for the destruction she had caused. Le Moan was only fourteen. She had heard of the coming of the new ruler to Karolin and of his bringing with him Katafa, the girl long thought to be dead. She had heard the order given to her grandfather Aioma that morning to come at once to the northern beach as the new chief required canoes to be built, and she had heard the old man's refusal. Le Moan had wondered what this new chief might be like. The monstrous great figure of Uta Matu, last king of Karolin, had come up in memory at the word \"chief,\" and now, as the canoe was hauled up and the women cried out \"He comes,\" she saw Dick.\nDick with the sun on his face and on his red-gold hair, Dick naked and honey-colored, lithe as a panther and straight as a stabbing spear. Dick with his eyes fixed on the three old men of Karolin who had turned their heads to gaze on him.\nLe Moan drew in her breath, then she seemed to cease breathing as the vision approached, passed her without a word, and stood facing Aioma, the eldest and the greatest of the canoe-builders.\nLe Moan was only fourteen, yet she was tall, almost as tall as Katafa. She was not a true Polynesian; though her mother had been a native of Karolin, her father, a sailor from a Spanish ship destroyed years ago by Uta Matu, had given the girl European characteristics so strong that she stood apart from the other islanders as a pine might stand amongst palm trees.\nShe was beautiful, with a dark beauty just beginning to unfold from the bud, and she was strange as the sea depths themselves. Sometimes seated alone beneath the towering jack-fruits, her head would poise as though she were listening, as though some voice were calling through the sound of the surf on the reef, some voice whose words she could not quite catch; and sometimes she would sit above the reef pools gazing deep down into the water, the crystal water where coralline growths bloomed and fish swam, but where she seemed to see more things than fish.\nThe sharp mixture of two utterly alien races sometimes produces strange results—it was almost at times as if Le Moan were confused by voices or visions from lands of ancestry worlds apart.\nShe would go with Aioma fishing, and with her on board, Aioma never dreaded losing sight of land, for Le Moan was a pathfinder. Blindfold her on the coral, and she would yet find her way on foot; take her beyond the sea-line, and she would return like a homing pigeon. Like the pigeon, she had the compass in her brain.\nThis was the only gift she had received from her mother, La Jennabon, who had received it from seafaring ancestors of the remote past.\nCrouching by the well, she saw now Dick standing before Aioma, and she heard his voice.\n\"You are Aioma?\" said Dick, who had singled the chief of the three out by instinct.\nThe three old men rose to their feet.

Without the outrigger, no canoe would dare venture into the open waters, and the islands would remain isolated, war would be impossible, and the exchange of ideas between island and continent would cease.\nSomewhere in the past, a visionary stood, the father of this daring invention, unaware of the consequences of his creation.\nAs Dick steered the canoe towards the northern beach, he spotted Katafa waiting for him, her wind-blown girdle of dracæna leaves, her hand shading her eyes from the sun. She stood, just as Le Moan stood on the southern beach, watching the canoe that carried the first man who had ever caught her attention.\nSome children played near Katafa, and a fishing canoe was setting out nearby, but Dick's eyes were fixed only on Katafa.\n\"Katafa,\" Aioma said, crouched by the outrigger pole. \"It's her, for sure, and they said she was dead, and her ghost had returned, bringing you with her, Taori, but the dead don't return.

He saw vaguely that these boats of the papalagi were constructed somewhat like a man, with a backbone and ribs, and a covering for the ribs. He saw that by this means, enough beam could be obtained to enable the builder to dispense with the outrigger—but then, speed, where was there a sign of speed in this squat and ugly thing?\nIn the early ages of the world, which Aioma still dwelled, ugliness had only two expressions: the lines that indicated want of speed and the lines that indicated want of strength.\nDick, though brown as the canoe-builder and almost indistinguishable from a true islander, was perhaps a million years younger than Aioma, just as the dinghy was a million years younger than the fishing canoe that had just brought him across the lagoon. In Dick, Aioma saw the lines that indicated speed and strength, nothing more—he was blind to the nobility of type expressed by that daring face, to the far-sightedness of the eyes, and the breadth of the brow; in the dinghy, Aioma saw want of speed—he was blind to the nobility of type that made this bud the sister of a battleship, made it a vertebrate as against the dugout, which has neither keel nor ribs.\nThen Aioma, standing in the sun, a plain canoe-builder and workman in the sight of God and a critic as every true workman is, began to deride the dinghy, at first with chuckles deep down in his throat, then with a sound like the clacking of a hen, then with laughter long and loud and words of derision.\n\"Which end is which of this pig fish?\" Aioma inquired of heaven and Dick, \"and he who made her, how many more did he make like her?\"\nDick, who had always connected the dinghy with Kearney, and who had a sort of faith that Kearney had made her, just as he had made the little model ships, winced at the laughter of the old man. Perhaps it was the white man in him revolting against the derision of a savage over the works of the white man. However that may be, he turned and ran up the beach to the house of Uta Matu, which he and Katafa had made their own. There, in the shadow, on a hastily constructed shelf stood the little model ships he had so carefully salvaged from Palm Tree: the frigate, the schooner, the full-rigged ship, and the whale man, the last thread connecting him with civilization; toys of the long ago, but no longer toys—fetishes from a world whose very language he had lost, a world of sun and tall trees where, like a ghost in the sun's dazzle, moved a memory that was once a man—Kearney.\nHe took the schooner from its rest and, coming out with it, ran to a great pool in the coral, calling Aioma to come and see what he who made the dinghy had also made.\nThe pool, thirty feet long by twenty broad, was ruffled by the breeze from the sea, clear as crystal, coral-floored, and a trapped school of tiny fish no larger than needles passed like a silver cloud here and there. Dick, on his knees, launched the schooner, and Aioma, standing bent with a hand on each knee, watched her as she floated on an even keel. Then, on the merry west wind, with helm properly set and main boom guyed out, she went sailing down the pool to the east, where Katafa had run to receive her.\nAioma watched, then Dick, running to the other end, showed him how she could sail almost against the wind. Dick knew every stick and string of her, how to hoist and lower main and fore, and how to set the head sails—and had you placed him on a real schooner, he could have worked her from his knowledge of the model. Aioma watched, vastly intrigued; then, taking a hand, he got on his knees, and the great sun saw the builders of the future fleet of Karolin playing like children, while the little schooner on its imitation sea sailed from port to port, bowing to the ripples of the pool as the lost Raratonga, of which it was the model, had bowed to the swell of the great Pacific.",

As Dick sprang out onto the sand, he seized her in his arms; it seemed to them that they had been weeks apart, not just hours.\nIn the old days, even before he was born, his mother Emmeline had never been at ease when separated from his father, even by the breadth of the lagoon. The demon that hinted at mischance seemed always at her ear. Dick seemed to have inherited, with his power of love for Katafa, a dread of mischance for the beloved. He embraced her, heedless of onlookers, though the only eyes that saw were the children's and Aioma's, who had eyes for nothing but the dinghy.\nAs soon as his foot touched the sand, the canoe-builder made for it, running like a boy, clapping his hand on the gunnel, and then running it over the planking. The boats of the Spanish ship of long ago had been clinker-built and destroyed in the fight, but he had seen bits of them washed ashore on the southern beach. The dinghy was carvel-built and entire, a perfect specimen of eastern boat-building, over which the canoe designer brooded, forgetful of Dick and Katafa, the beach he stood on, and the sun that lit it.\nThe idea of a boat built from planking and not hollowed out of a tree trunk had been presented to him by the charred and shattered fragments of the Spanish boats, but how to get planking and how to bend it to the form he desired was beyond his imagination and means. He saw vaguely that these boats of the papalagi were constructed somewhat like a man, with a backbone and ribs, and a covering for the ribs. He saw that by this means, enough beam could be obtained to enable the builder to dispense with the outrigger—but then, speed, where was there a sign of speed in this squat and ugly thing?\nIn the early ages of the world, which Aioma still dwelled, ugliness had only two expressions: the lines that indicated want of speed and the lines that indicated want of strength. Dick, though brown as the canoe-builder and almost indistinguishable from a true islander, was perhaps a million years younger than Aioma, just as the dinghy was a million years younger than the fishing canoe that had just brought him across the lagoon. In Dick, Aioma saw the lines that indicated speed and strength, nothing more—he was blind to the nobility of type expressed by that daring face, to the far-sightedness of the eyes, and the breadth of the brow; in the dinghy, Aioma saw want of speed—he was blind to the nobility of type that made this bud the sister of a battleship, made it a vertebrate as against the dugout, which has neither keel nor ribs.\nThen Aioma, standing in the sun, a plain canoe-builder and workman in the sight of God and a critic as every true workman is, began to deride the dinghy, at first with chuckles deep down in his throat, then with a sound like the clacking of a hen, then with laughter long and loud and words of derision. \"Which end is which of this pig fish?\" Aioma inquired of heaven and Dick, \"and he who made her, how many more did he make like her?\"\nDick, who had always connected the dinghy with Kearney, and who had a sort of faith that Kearney had made her, just as he had made the little model ships, winced at the laughter of the old man. Perhaps it was the white man in him revolting against the derision of a savage over the works of the white man. However that may be, he turned and ran up the beach to the house of Uta Matu, which he and Katafa had made their own. There, in the shadow, on a hastily constructed shelf stood the little model ships he had so carefully salvaged from Palm Tree: the frigate, the schooner, the full-rigged ship, and the whale man, the last thread connecting him with civilization; toys of the long ago, but no longer toys—fetishes from a world whose very language he had lost, a world of sun and tall trees where, like a ghost in the sun's dazzle, moved a memory that was once a man—Kearney.\nHe took the schooner from its rest and, coming out with it, ran to a great pool in the coral, calling Aioma to come and see what he who made the dinghy had also made. The pool, thirty feet long by twenty broad, was ruffled by the breeze from the sea, clear as crystal, coral-floored, and a trapped school of tiny fish no larger than needles passed like a silver cloud here and there. Dick, on his knees, launched the schooner, and Aioma, standing bent with a hand on each knee, watched her as she floated on an even keel. Then, on the merry west wind, with helm properly set and main boom guyed out, she went sailing down the pool to the east, where Katafa had run to receive her.\nAioma watched, then Dick, running to the other end, showed him how she could sail almost against the wind. Dick knew every stick and string of her, how to hoist and lower main and fore, and how to set the head sails—and had you placed him on a real schooner, he could have worked her from his knowledge of the model. Aioma watched, vastly intrigued; then, taking a hand, he got on his knees, and the great sun saw the builders of the future fleet of Karolin playing like children, while the little schooner on its imitation sea sailed from port to port, bowing to the ripples of the pool as the lost Raratonga, of which it was the model, had bowed to the swell of the great Pacific."
